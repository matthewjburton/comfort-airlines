# Cloud Nine Requirements

- **Team Name:** Cloud Nine  
- **Team Members:** Jeremy Maas, Matt Burton, McHale Trotter, Kevin Sampson, Justin Chen, Ryan Hirscher

## Timetable

We will provide a timetable that contains the list of flights that will be performed each day. Using this you will be aware of any layovers, delays, flight time (and thus cost), and gate information. This will allow flyers to choose a wide variety of flights and take a route that best suites their needs.

## Simulation 

- Run a simulation based on the timetable provided 
- Will provide report of operating costs, revenue raised, net profits based on the flights ran (This is currently not implemented)
- Cost estimates are currently accurate because we account for:
    - Wind speed/Jet stream
    - Earth Curvature 
    - Bearing angle between airports
- We will further improve cost estimates by implementing accounting for the following in the future:
    - Delays
    - Cancellations
    - Aircraft faliures
- Simulation will additionally provide a number of people who flew over the course of the simulation
