## Synopsis

Prior to this meeting a GitHub repository and a Discord server had been created and shared to all team members.
For our IDE we decided to use VS Code because it has an integrated terminal and support for Git. For the agile development process, we decided to use Jira. Jira supports issues, scrum points, child issues, bug issues, and creating git branches. All team members have been confirmed access to the Jira board. To start working on an issue, make a branch using the option in Jira, open the branch in VS Code, modify the codebase to solve the relevant issue, push the changes, create a merge request, have another member review your merge request, and finally submit your merge request. When creating a new issue, assign points based on the scrum scale(chart in team discord). More points are assigned to issues requiring more time or people.
We decided on the team name Cloud Nine.
